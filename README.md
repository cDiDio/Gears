# Gears
homepage study project

Gears was one of my project during the annual diploma in web design. The particularity of the index is that is totally Css responsive. No js file was written to made the hamburger-menu.
In the home page of gears I used the Css3 rules, with gradient, transition, shadows and transform, with all the vendor they need to run.
